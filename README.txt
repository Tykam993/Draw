Draw!  README

Draw is a two-player, old west style duel simulator.

Player 1 fires with A and player 2 fires with L.

When the round starts, the players walk away from each other for 2-5 seconds.  Once they stop moving and hear the "Draw!" they can fire at each other.
The first player to fire gets a point for the round and the first player to get three points wins the game.
